Package Description: Two-group combined miRNA- and mRNA- expression testing.
}
\description{
Looking for differential expression in miRNA-data can have low power. Taking their respective mRNA-gene sets on the other hand
can lead to too liberal results. In Artmann et al. we proposed a method to combine both information sources and generate p-values
that can detect either miRNA-, or target gene set expression differences.

First, a priori-defined gene sets 
need to be supplied. In the end, you need an allocation matrix A. To generate one
see the function "generate.A" in this package.
Then you can start the test with the "miR.test" function, which needs the expression matrix X
of miRNAs, the expression matrix Y of mRNAs and the allocation matrix.
