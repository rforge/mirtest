	abstract = "{BACKGROUND:Analysis} of microarray experiments often involves testing for the overrepresentation of pre-defined sets of genes among lists of genes deemed individually significant. Most popular gene set testing methods assume the independence of genes within each set, an assumption that is seriously violated, as extensive correlation between genes is a well-documented {phenomenon.RESULTS:We} conducted a meta-analysis of over 200 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus in order to demonstrate the practical impact of strong gene correlation patterns that are highly consistent across experiments. We show that a common independence assumption-based gene set testing procedure produces very high false positive rates when applied to data sets for which treatment groups have been randomized, and that gene sets with high internal correlation are more likely to be declared significant. A reanalysis of the same datasets using an array resampling approach properly controls false positive rates, leading to more parsimonious and high-confidence gene set findings, which should facilitate pathway-based interpretation of the microarray {data.CONCLUSIONS:These} findings call into question many of the gene set testing results in the literature and argue strongly for the adoption of resampling based gene set testing criteria in the peer reviewed biomedical literature.",

We present a computational method for whole-genome prediction of {miRNA} target genes. The method is validated using known examples. For each {miRNA,} target genes are selected on the basis of three properties: sequence complementarity using a position-weighted local alignment algorithm, free energies of {RNA-RNA} duplexes, and conservation of target sites in related genomes. Application to the D. melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae genomes identifies several hundred target genes potentially regulated by one or more known {miRNAs.{\textless}/AbstractText{\textgreater}} {{\textless}AbstractText} {Label="RESULTS"} {NlmCategory="RESULTS"{\textgreater}These} potential targets are rich in genes that are expressed at specific developmental stages and that are involved in cell fate specification, morphogenesis and the coordination of developmental processes, as well as genes that are active in the mature nervous system.

Our results reaffirm the thesis that {miRNAs} have an important role in establishing the complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene activity necessary for the orderly progression of development and suggest additional roles in the function of the mature organism.

After all these steps are taken into account, the simulated data has realistic biological and statistical characteristics. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated by several {examples.CONCLUSION:The} proposed microarray simulation model is modular and can be used in different kinds of applications. It includes several error models that have been proposed earlier and it can be used with different types of input data. The model can be used to simulate both spotted two-channel and oligonucleotide based single-channel microarrays. All this makes the model a valuable tool for example in validation of data analysis algorithms.",

The transcription patterns of all {miRNA} host genes were curated from a variety of sources illustrating spatial, temporal, and physiological regulation of {miRNA} expression.

However, knowledge bases such as the Gene Ontology {(GO)} contain hundreds or thousands of categories with very high overlap between categories. Thus, enrichment analysis performed on one category at a time frequently returns large numbers of correlated categories, leaving the choice of the most relevant ones to the user's; interpretation. Here we present model-based gene set analysis {(MGSA)} that analyzes all categories at once by embedding them in a Bayesian network, in which gene response is modeled as a function of the activation of biological categories. Probabilistic inference is used to identify the active categories. The Bayesian modeling approach naturally takes category overlap into account and avoids the need for multiple testing corrections met in single-category enrichment analysis. On simulated data, {MGSA} identifies active categories with up to 95\% precision at a recall of 20\% for moderate settings of noise, leading to a 10-fold precision improvement over single-category statistical enrichment analysis. Application to a gene expression data set in yeast demonstrates that the method provides high-level, summarized views of core biological processes and correctly eliminates confounding associations.",

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate \$t\$. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven {FDR} control can be offered is greatly increased.",

These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform {favorably.Availability:} Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project {http://www.bioconductor.org.Contact:} {bolstad@stat.berkeley.edu.Supplementary} information: Additional figures may be found at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}bolstad/normalize/index.html",

	abstract = "Gene Set Enrichment Analysis {(GSEA)} is a method for analysing gene expression data with a focus on a priori defined gene sets. The permutation test generally used in {GSEA} for testing the significance of gene set enrichment involves permutation of a phenotype vector and is developed for data from an indirect comparison design, i.e. unpaired data. In some studies the samples representing two phenotypes are paired, e.g. samples taken from a patient before and after treatment, or if samples representing two phenotypes are hybridised to the same two-channel array (direct comparison design). In this paper we will focus on data from direct comparison experiments, but the methods can be applied to paired data in general. For these types of data, a standard permutation test for paired data that randomly re-signs samples can be used. However, if the sample size is very small, which is often the case for a direct comparison design, a permutation test will give very imprecise estimates of the p-values. Here we propose using a rotation test rather than a permutation test for estimation of significance in {GSEA} of direct comparison data with a limited number of samples. Our proposed rotation test makes {GSEA} applicable to direct comparison data with few samples, by depending on rotations of the data instead of permutations. The rotation test is a generalisation of the permutation test, and can in addition be used on indirect comparison data and for testing significance of other types of test statistics outside the {GSEA} framework.",

The biological question of differential expression can be restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and the responses or covariates. As a typical microarray experiment measures expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, large multiplicity problems are generated.

These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing. {RESULTS:} We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.",

The purpose of this article is to follow the third direction. One important aspect is that the gene sets under analysis are known a priori and are not determined from the experimental data at hand. Our goal is to provide a methodology that helps to identify the relevant structural constituents (phenotypical, experimental design, biological component) that determine gene expression in a {group.Results:} Gene-wise linear models are used to formalize the structural aspects of a study. The full model is contrasted with a reduced model that lacks the relevant design component. A comparison with respect to goodness of fit is made and quantified. An asymptotic test and a permutation test are derived to test the null hypothesis that the reduced model sufficiently explains the observed expression within the gene group of interest. Graphical tools are available to illustrate and interpret the results of the analysis.

Microarrays can be used to measure the relative quantities of specific {mRNAs} in two or more tissue samples for thousands of genes simultaneously. While the power of this technology has been recognized, many open questions remain about appropriate analysis of microarray data. One question is how to make valid estimates of the relative expression for genes that are not biased by ancillary sources of variation. Recognizing that there is inherent "noise" in microarray data, how does one estimate the error variation associated with an estimated change in expression, i.e., how does one construct the error bars? We demonstrate that {ANOVA} methods can be used to normalize microarray data and provide estimates of changes in gene expression that are corrected for potential confounding effects. This approach establishes a framework for the general analysis and interpretation of microarray data.},

The study was conducted to investigate inherent variability in gene expression data and the extent to which replication in an experiment produces more consistent and reliable findings. We introduce a statistical model to describe the probability that {mRNA} is contained in the target sample tissue, converted to probe, and ultimately detected on the slide. We also introduce a method to analyze the combined data from all replicates. Of the 288 genes considered in this controlled experiment, 32 would be expected to produce strong hybridization signals because of the known presence of repetitive sequences within them. Results based on individual replicates, however, show that there are 55, 36, and 58 highly expressed genes in replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On the other hand, an analysis by using the combined data from all 3 replicates reveals that only 2 of the 288 genes are incorrectly classified as expressed. Our experiment shows that any single microarray output is subject to substantial variability. By pooling data from replicates, we can provide a more reliable analysis of gene expression data. Therefore, we conclude that designing experiments with replications will greatly reduce misclassification rates. We recommend that at least three replicates be used in designing experiments by using {cDNA} microarrays, particularly when gene expression data from single specimens are being analyzed.",

	abstract = "Motivation: Transcriptomic studies using microarray technology have become a standard tool in life sciences in the last decade. Nevertheless the cost of these experiments remains high and forces scientists to work with small sample sizes at the expense of statistical power. In many cases, little or no prior knowledge on the underlying variability is available, which would allow an accurate estimation of the number of samples (microarrays) required to answer a particular biological question of interest. We investigate sequential methods, also called group sequential or adaptive designs in the context of clinical trials, for microarray analysis. Through interim analyses at different stages of the experiment and application of a stopping rule a decision can be made as to whether more samples should be studied or whether the experiment has yielded enough information already. Results: The high dimensionality of microarray data facilitates the sequential approach. Since thousands of genes simultaneously contribute to the stopping decision, the marginal distribution of any single gene is nearly independent of the global stopping rule. For this reason, the interim analysis does not seriously bias the final p-values. We propose a meta-analysis approach to combining the results of the interim analyses at different stages. We consider stopping rules that are either based on the estimated number of true positives or on a sensitivity estimate and particularly discuss the difficulty of estimating the latter. We study this sequential method in an extensive simulation study and also apply it to several real data sets. The results show that applying sequential methods can reduce the number of microarrays without substantial loss of power.
